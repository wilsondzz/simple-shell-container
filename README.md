Simple Docker Shell container

 Sometimes reading articles on the Web, something catches my eye (not usually because
 I ignore and block out ad's) but, when I saw "your doing docker containers wrong",
 I had to see if my knowledge is lacking in some area (God forbid!). Sure enough, it
 was actually something I have been researching lately with Docker containders, PID 1.

 Therefore, I learn best by doing, so as I read the article I though I would build a
 simple container to use for appling these principles.

 Now, the idea has grown, what about a container, that uses SSH and allows me to load
 and then connect in an isolated environment, or what about for development.
